            Joseph is a Sacred Artist living in St. Louis, Missouri. He
            graduated from Saint Louis University with a degree in Philosophy.
            For his capstone project, he completed a painting incorporating
            themes from the Philosophical Anthropology of Karol Wojtyla (later
            Pope John Paul II).

            He now works full-time on computer programming in order to support
            his fianc√©e and future family, while studying art, philosophy, and
            theology in his free time. He hopes to contribute to a culture which
            recognizes the true dignity and vocation of the human person
            inscribed in us from "the beginning."

            Part of Joseph's love for art stems from an understanding of the
            human person grounded in the thought of Pope St. John Paul II.
            Joseph believes that beautiful art is grounded in a complete view of
            the human person, which recognizes our fundamental call to love. You
            can read more about Joseph's thoughts on the intersection of
            Anthropology and art on his blog.
